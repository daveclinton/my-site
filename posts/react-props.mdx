## Introduction
<p className='lead'>
Let's start by defining props and their primary function in order to understand the React Props paradigm. 
Properties, often known as "props" in React, are an essential component of improving the reusability of React components.

In a nutshell, props are used in React apps to facilitate communication between components. A very important characteristic of any framework based on component-driven architecture is component communication. Most well-known frameworks, like Angular and Vue.js, offer unique methods for how components transfer data to one another.

Every single UI unit in a component-driven system is built up of components. Now that each of these parts would need to share data among themselves, you can see why frameworks must have this. 
For instance, we have the components shown below.


| Parent  Conponent                |              |                    |

| Child Component         | Child Component  | Child Component|
